# Comparative Study of Convolutional Neural Network Models for Image Classification


## Project Description

This project conducts a comparative study of various convolutional neural network (CNN) models for image classification. The goal is to compare the performance of models trained from scratch with those using transfer learning, specifically VGG16 and VGG19, with different configurations. The aim is to identify best practices and approaches for image classification tasks.
